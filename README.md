# Browser
I have a vacation this December, so I am working on building a browser project.
I will write progress in this README.

## Resources:
1) How do browsers work?[https://web.dev/articles/howbrowserswork]
2) Web browser Engineering book[https://browser.engineering]

## Name:
I am still thinking about a name for the project. I will pick it up in a day or two.

## Target:
One chapter of the book in two days.

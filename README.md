# Browser
- I have a vacation this December, so I am working on building a browser project.
- I will write progress in this README.

### Resources:
1) [How do browsers work?](https://web.dev/articles/howbrowserswork)
2) [Web browser Engineering book](https://browser.engineering)

### Name:
I am still thinking about a name for the project. I will pick it up in a day or two.

### Target:
One chapter of the book in two days.

### How to run:
I don't know why, bs4 module is not detected by python3. Actually my settings are pretty messed up as I didn't how to setup back in my first year and I am carrying those settings around.
So how to run section is for me to remember how to run.
- #### Chapter1.py & Chapter2.py;
    - Command -> python3-intel64 Chapter1.py <site_address>
    - Here site address must have http:// or https:// before URL.

### What I learnt:
Here is a section for me to remember what I learnt from the chapter.
 - #### Chapter 1:
    - Brushed up my network concepts.
    - Made a basic url request fetcher.
    - Added TLS wrap over HTTP for HTTPS.
    - SOCK_STREAM -> For a stream of data (any length) and SOCK_DGRAM for fixed-sized data.
    - Port : HTTP -> 80 , HTTPS -> 443.
- #### Chapter 2:
    - Tkinter X-position is from left to right and Y-position is from top to bottom.
    - Bind Configure Event for resizing.
    - ScrollBar is an object in Tk that can integrate to canvas or frame (Somehow it is not working for me).

### Fixes:
1) Python reinstall and clean up for modules to run.
2) Scrollbar not scrolling the canvas.
3) Touchpad event not working (if it is considered as mouse event).
